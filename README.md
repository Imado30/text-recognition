# Text-Recognition-System

## Overview

#### This project utilizes OpenCV, OCR technology, and multiprocessing to create an efficient system for recognizing and extracting text from images. It processes text based on spacing and font sizes, improving the accuracy of extraction


## Key Features

- **Text Extraction:** Detects and extracts text from images for further processing
- **Advanced Analysis:** Analyzes the spatial arrangement of text, considering factors like spacing and font sizes to distinguish between different textual elements.
- **Efficiency:** Enhanced processing speed through multiprocessing


## Usage

#### Users can upload images to extract text, which is then available for copying or further manipulation, suitable for digitizing documents or automating data entry.
